"Tic-Tac-Toe" application for Easi.

To launch the application, you'll need _Android Studio_ on your device.

Once you have it, clone this repository and open it on _Android Studio_. Then, on "File", click on "Synch Project with Gradle Files".

After the synchronization, you can launch the application to start a game.

Enjoy ;)
